# The Flux Operator

<img style="width:50%" alt="Coming Soon" src="_static/images/coming-soon.png">


Welcome to the Flux Operator Documentation!

The Flux Operator is a Kubernetes Cluster [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) 
that you can install to your cluster to create and control [Flux Framework](https://flux-framework.org/) "Mini Clusters"
to launch jobs to. With the Flux Operator you can:

1. Create an ephemeral Mini Cluster to run one job
2. Create a persistent Mini Cluster to submit jobs to via user interface, command line, or language SDK.
3. View logs and job information via the same interfaces!

The Flux Operator is currently üößÔ∏è Under Construction! üößÔ∏è
We are working on core functionality along with providing a library of
examples from HPC. This is a *converged computing* project that aims
to unite the worlds and technologies typical of cloud computing and
high performance computing.
