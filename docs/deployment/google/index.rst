Google Cloud
============

On Google Cloud, "GKE" refers to Google Kubernetes Engine. Kubernetes was originally a Google project,
so it works really well on Google Cloud, and it's super fun to use the Flux Operator there! This
guide will walk you through the basics, including tutorials that go from basic to using
different types of container storage interfaces.  If you have a question, please
