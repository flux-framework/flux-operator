# User Guide

The Flux RESTFUl API is a FastAPI application that makes it easy to
interact with a single user Flux cluster via a RESTFul endpoint.
While we currently provide an example client in the [examples](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-restful-api/tree/main/examples)
folder, we will soon add other client implementations for your choosing.
This documentation includes a developer guide, and user guide
for client interactions. If you have
any questions or issues, please [let us know](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-restful-api/issues)
