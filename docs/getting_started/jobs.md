# Jobs

Given a running MiniCluster that exposes a RESTful API, you have several modes for interaction:

1. Submit jobs in the user interface (basic)
2. Submit jobs from the command line "RESTful" or within Python (custom)
3. Use a helper tool "flux-cloud"
4. Submit jobs interacting with Flux via ssh-ing to the pod (advanced)

We provide [clients](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-restful-api/tree/main/clients) to interact with
a running server, and each will be briefly shown below. The Python client is also included in our [Tutorials](https://flux-framework.org/flux-restful-api/auto_examples/index.html).

## Credentials

Whether you use a command line client, a language SDK, or the web interface - you need your credentials!
The credentials are printed in the log of the index-0. These are the `FLUX_USER` and `FLUX_TOKEN` 
environment variables. A client requires exported them to the environment, and the web interface requires
copy paste into a form. 

```bash
# get the job pod identifier for index 0, the broker
$ kubectl get -n flux-operator pods
$ kubectl logs -n flux-operator ${brokerPod}
```
```console
üîë Your Credentials! These will allow you to control your MiniCluster with flux-framework/flux-restful-api
export FLUX_TOKEN=9c605129-3ddc-41e2-9a23-38f59fb8f8e0
export FLUX_USER=flux

üåÄsudo -u flux flux start -o --config /etc/flux/config ...
```

Note that they appear slightly above the command, which isn't at the bottom of the log!

## Ways to Submit

### 1. User Interface

To see the user interface, you'll first need to do some kind of port forwarding:

```console
kubectl port-forward -n flux-operator flux-sample-0-zdhkp 5000:5000
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:5000 -> 5000
```

This should be exposed at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). It's not terribly informative, so
we won't show the main portal here! ü§≠

After your MiniCluster is created with a RESTFul API, the easiest thing to do is open the user interface to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
After port forwarding in a terminal and then submitting in the job UI (you will need to login with the flux user and token presented in the terminal). Here is the example command to try
for the basic tutorial here:

```console
lmp -v x 2 -v y 2 -v z 2 -in in.reaxc.hns -nocite
```

And the workdir for this default example needs to be:

```console
/home/flux/examples/reaxff/HNS
```
![img/submit.png](img/submit.png)

After submit, you can view the job in the jobs table:

![img/jobs-table.png](img/jobs-table.png)

And click the identifier to see logs (currently blocking so will wait until it's done, soon won't be!)

![img/job-info.png](img/job-info.png)

And that's it for the example! You can further explore the exposed API in the web interface:

![img/api.png](img/api.png)

And you can also try using the [RESTFul API Clients](https://flux-framework.org/flux-restful-api/getting_started/user-guide.html) to submit instead
(discussed next). Note that there is currently no way for the RESTful client to ask to destroy the cluster - you'll
still need to use kubectl to do that.

### 2. Command Line or Python

Remember that before starting you'll need to export your `FLUX_USER` and `FLUX_TOKEN` to the environment:

```bash
# get the job pod identifier for index 0, the broker
$ kubectl get -n flux-operator pods
$ kubectl logs -n flux-operator ${brokerPod}
```
```console
üîë Your Credentials! These will allow you to control your MiniCluster with flux-framework/flux-restful-api
export FLUX_TOKEN=9c605129-3ddc-41e2-9a23-38f59fb8f8e0
export FLUX_USER=flux

üåÄsudo -u flux flux start -o --config /etc/flux/config ...
```

Next, you can use the [flux-framework/flux-restful-api](https://flux-framework.org/flux-restful-api/getting_started/user-guide.html#python)
Python client to submit a job.

```bash
$ pip install flux-restful-client
```
And then (after you've started port forwarding) you can either submit on the command line:

```bash
$ flux-restful-cli submit lmp -v x 2 -v y 2 -v z 2 -in in.reaxc.hns -nocite
```
```console
{
    "Message": "Job submit.",
    "id": 19099568570368
}
```
And get info:

```bash
$ flux-restful-cli info 19099568570368
```
```console
{
    "id": 2324869152768,
    "userid": 1234,
    "urgency": 16,
    "priority": 16,

    },

        "severity": "",
        "type": "",
        "note": ""
    },
    "duration": ""
}
```

Or get the output log!

```bash
$ flux-restful-cli logs 2324869152768

Or do the same from within Python:

```python
from flux_restful_client.main import get_client

cli = get_client()

# Define our jop
command = "lmp -v x 2 -v y 2 -v z 2 -in in.reaxc.hns -nocite"

# Submit the job to flux
print(f"üò¥ Submitting job: {command}")
res = cli.submit(command=command)
print(json.dumps(res, indent=4))

# Get job information
print("üçì Getting job info...")
jobid = res['id']
res = cli.jobs(jobid)
print(json.dumps(res, indent=4))

# Get job output log
print("üçï Getting job output...")
res = cli.output(jobid)
print(json.dumps(res, indent=4))
```

### 3. Flux Cloud Helper Tool

If you have a set of experiments you want to run on a production cluster, and especially
if you don't want the cluster being up longer than it has to be, check out [Flux Cloud](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-cloud).
It's a small experiment runner wrapper that makes bringing up the cluster, installing
the operator, running a matrix of experiments, and destroying the cluster much
easier than all the copy pasting of commands typically required! 

### 4. Advanced Shell

You can also submit jobs interacting with Flux via ssh-ing to the pod! This is considered 
advanced, and is good for debugging. As you did before, get your pod listing:

```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-operator pods
```
And then shell in

```bash
$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty -n flux-operator ${brokerPod} -- /bin/bash
```

Note that if you have more than one container, you'll need to include it's name with `-c <container>`.
Also note that if you need to load any custom environments (e.g., something you'd define in the preCommand for a container)
you'll likely need to do that when you shell in.
