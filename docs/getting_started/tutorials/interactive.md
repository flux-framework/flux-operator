# Interactive

The following tutorials demonstrate interactive MiniClusters, beyond using the Flux Restful API or
launching a job to run and complete.

## Shell

 **[Tutorial File](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/blob/main/examples/interactive/minicluster-shell.yaml)**

This example demonstrates bringing up a MiniCluster solely to shell in and interact with Flux. First, 
note that there is nothing special about the MiniCluster YAML except that the command is intended
to run forever, a `sleep infinity`.

```yaml
apiVersion: flux-framework.org/v1alpha1
kind: MiniCluster
metadata:
  name: flux-sample
  namespace: flux-operator
spec:

  # Number of pods to create for MiniCluster
  size: 2

  # This is a list because a pod can support multiple containers
  containers:
    # The container URI to pull (currently needs to be public)
    - image: ghcr.io/rse-ops/pokemon:app-latest
      fluxOptionFlags: "-ompi=openmpi@5"
      command: sleep infinity
```

The container you choose should have the software you are interested in having for each node.
Given a running cluster, we can create the namespace and the MiniCluster as follows:

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace flux-operator
$ kubectl apply -f examples/interactive/minicluster-shell.yaml
```

We can then wait for our pods to be running

```bash
$ kubectl get -n flux-operator pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
flux-sample-0-p5xls          1/1     Running     0          7s
flux-sample-1-nmtt7          1/1     Running     0          7s
flux-sample-cert-generator   0/1     Completed   0          7s
```

And then shell into the broker pod, index 0:

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it  -n flux-operator  flux-sample-0-p5xls -- bash
```

At this point, remember the broker is running, and we need to connect to it. We do this via
flux proxy and targeting the socket, which is a local reference at `/run/flux/local`:

```bash
# Connect to the flux socket at /run/flux/local as the flux instance owner "flux"
$ sudo -u flux flux proxy local:///run/flux/local
```

At this point, you are the instance owner "flux":

```bash
$ whoami
flux
```
And can also see the resources known to your instance!

```bash
flux@flux-sample-0:/code$ flux resource list
     STATE NNODES   NCORES NODELIST
      free      1        1 flux-sample-0
 allocated      1        1 flux-sample-1
      down      0        0 
```

At this point you have your own Flux install connected to your entire MiniCluster,
and you can launch and monitor jobs as you please.

```bash
$ flux submit sleep 120
ƒ34hRjsAX
```

Note that under flux jobs below, the first sleep (flux-sample-1) is the command
originally given to the broker. The second, newer sleep is the job we just launched.

```bash
flux@flux-sample-0:/code$ flux jobs
       JOBID USER     NAME       ST NTASKS NNODES     TIME INFO
   ƒ34hRjsAX flux     sleep       R      1      1   2.342s flux-sample-0
     ƒVjP5kb flux     sleep       R      1      1   4.547m flux-sample-1
```

When you are done, exit from the instance, and exit from the pod, and then delete
the MiniCluster.

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f examples/interactive/minicluster-shell.yaml
```
