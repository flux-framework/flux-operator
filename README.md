The Flux Operator is a Kubernetes Cluster [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
that you can install to your cluster to create and control a [Flux Framework](https://flux-framework.org/) "MiniCluster"
to launch jobs to.

## Organization

The basic idea is that we present the idea of a **MiniCluster** that is a custom resource definition (CRD)
that defines a job container (that does not need to have Flux) that (when submit) will create a set of config maps,
secrets, and the final Indexed Job that has the pod containers running with Flux. Since
this is a batchv1.Job, it will have states that we can track.

And you can find the following here:

 - [Flux Controllers](controllers/flux) are under `controllers/flux` for the `MiniCluster`
 - [API Spec](api/v1alpha1/) are under `api/v1alpha2/` also for `MiniCluster`
 - [Packages](pkg) include supporting packages for job conditions (state), if we eventually want that.
 - [Config](config) includes mostly automatically generated yaml configuration files needed by Kubernetes

And the following external resources might be useful:

 - [Flux Framework](https://flux-framework.org)
 - [Flux RESTful API](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-restful-api): provides the interface for submitting jobs, if no command provided to the operator.
 - [Python SDK](sdk/python): for deploying MiniClusters and port forwarding.
 - [Flux HPC Examples](https://github.com/rse-ops/flux-hpc) containers and CRD for the operator to run Flux with HPC workloads (under development)
 - [Flux Cloud](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-cloud): automation of experiments using the Flux Operator
