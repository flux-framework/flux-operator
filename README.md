# Flux Operator

![docs/development/the-operator.jpg](docs/development/the-operator.jpg)

The Flux Operator is a Kubernetes Cluster [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
that you can install to your cluster to create and control [Flux Framework](https://flux-framework.org/) "Mini Clusters"
to launch jobs to.

üößÔ∏è Under Construction! üößÔ∏è

**Important!** We recently removed a one-off container that ran before the MiniCluster creation to generate a certificate.
We have found [through testing](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/issues/104) that this somehow served as a warmup
for networking, and this means if you use the latest operator here, you may see slow times in creating the initial
broker setup. We have two sets of bugfixes to go in that should resolve this:

 - An update to set the zeromq timeout (TBA soon)
 - a TBA update to resolve whatever the noticed bug is above (TBA unknown)

With the bug, you might see creation times between 40-140 seconds for a single MiniCluster, which is abysmal.
With the fix to zeromq, this goes does to 19-20. With the further addition of adding the warmup service, it goes
down to ~16. With the service plus a better networking setup than kube-dns, it returns to the original 11-12 seconds.
Thank you for your patience as we work on this - we will hopefully get everything resolved soon!

## Organization

The basic idea is that we present the idea of a **MiniCluster** that is a custom resource definition (CRD)
that defines a job container (that must have Flux) that (when submit) will create a set of config maps,
secrets (e.g., tls), and the final Batch job that has the pod containers running with flux. Since
this is a batchv1.Job, it will have states that we can track.

And you can find the following here:

 - [Flux Controllers](controllers/flux) are under `controllers/flux` for the `MiniCluster`
 - [API Spec](api/v1alpha1/) are under `api/v1alpha1/` also for `MiniCluster`
 - [Packages](pkg) include supporting packages for job conditions (state), if we eventually want that.
 - [Config](config) includes mostly automatically generated yaml configuration files needed by Kubernetes

And the following external resources might be useful:

 - [Flux Cloud](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-cloud): automation of experiments using the Flux Operator
 - [Flux RESTful API](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-restful-api): provides the interface for submitting jobs, if no command provided to the operator.
 - [Python SDK](sdk/python): for deploying MiniClusters and port forwarding.
 - [Flux HPC Examples](https://github.com/rse-ops/flux-hpc) containers and CRD for the operator to run Flux with HPC workloads (under development)

**Note** this project is actively under development, and you can expect change and improvements!
We apologize for bugs you run into, and hope you tell us soon so we can work on resolving them.
